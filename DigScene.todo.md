# Must do

- Collision boxes for player and zombies are way too big
- Zombies can't run over ladders
- Player can't usually go right down a ladder after digging it b/c collision issues
- Player needs a reason not to stay below ground
- Player needs an objective to not stay above ground for too long

# Should do

- Show current action snapped to tile (e.g. dirt, ladder, or ground centered on tile)

# Could do

- Add time (and animation) to break dirt
- Player action is always space

# Polish

- Change player sprite below-ground to be top-down
- Unpassable player boundaries at edges of tilemap
- Bug: Putting dirt on top layer of tiles doesn't erase the ladder
- Bug: Can dig diagonally even if tile is surrounded by other dirt tiles
- Camera bounds on edges of tilemap
